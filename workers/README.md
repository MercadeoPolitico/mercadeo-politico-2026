# Workers (Railway) — placeholder

This folder is reserved for future background workers (e.g., scheduled jobs, content ingestion, automation hooks).

**Important:** No Railway services are implemented yet (by design). When we add workers later, they will:
- Run independently from the Next.js web app
- Use environment variables (never hardcoded secrets)
- Use Supabase server-side credentials only where strictly required
