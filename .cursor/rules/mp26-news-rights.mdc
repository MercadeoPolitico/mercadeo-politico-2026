# MP26: News sourcing & rights guardrails

- Do not scrape and republish full text from commercial news sites.
- Prefer:
  - Official/open government feeds
  - RSS/Atom/JSON endpoints where usage is allowed
  - Link-only citation to the original source URL
  - Our own analysis text (500–800 words) generated from metadata + candidate program
- Images:
  - Publish only CC (Wikimedia) or first-party assets
  - Never hotlink/redistribute publisher images (use OG images as reference-only metadata if needed)
- Any feed used by automation must be explicitly approved (`license_confirmed = true`) unless it is clearly open government.
